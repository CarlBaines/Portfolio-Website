            <p>The Occupational Specialism project served as the final assessment for my T-Level course. This project challenged me to develop a functional prototype based on a detailed project brief while also producing comprehensive documentation to plan, design, and explain the prototypeâ€™s code and functionality. The brief was centered around a hypothetical scenario involving a client named Riget Zoo Adventures, requiring me to apply my problem-solving skills, technical knowledge, and software development best practices to create an effective solution.</p>
