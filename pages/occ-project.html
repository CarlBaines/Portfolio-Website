            <p>To develop the prototype for Riget Zoo Adventures, I implemented secure code using C# with Windows Forms for the front-end and SQL for stored procedures and database queries in the back-end. I gathered and prepared all necessary assets, such as images and icons, and maintained an assets log to document the sources, content, purpose, and retrieval dates. During development, I employed iterative testing to verify inputs, calculations, validation, and processes with appropriate test data, and documented the iterative approach and any changes made. I ensured that the code was maintainable by third parties and focused on delivering a high-quality user experience. Additionally, I adhered to all legal and regulatory guidelines and standards, with comprehensive documentation reflecting the development process and modifications.</p>
