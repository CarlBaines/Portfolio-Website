          This was a team-based project focused on system and application
          design. It was one of my first experiences working collaboratively on
          a structured design-focused project, and it proved to be a really
          valuable learning opportunity. I took on the role of document
          manager, which meant I was responsible for organising and
          maintaining all project documentation, ensuring everything was clearly
          written, up-to-date, and met the assignment requirements. As a group,
          we were tasked with planning and designing an original app idea,
          including its core functionality and how the system would work. We
          used a range of industry-standard diagrams and tools such as use case
          diagrams, data flow diagrams, wireframes, and ERDs to present our
          vision in a structured and professional way. Working on this project
          helped me strengthen both my teamwork and documentation skills, and it
          gave me a solid foundation in system design concepts that I’ll carry
          forward into future development work. I received a mark of 32.8 out of 40 for my
          contribution as document manager, which contributed to my overall
          grade of 83% (a 1st) for the project—25% of which was
          based on group collaboration and 75% on individual work.
