            <p>This is a simple to-do list web application that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created it as
                a small personal project to help me re-familiarise myself with HTML and CSS syntax, and to learn how to
                use JavaScript alongside them to add interactivity. The app allows users to add, check off, and delete
                tasks, and it saves the list to the browser’s local storage so tasks remain after refreshing the page.
                It also displays the current date and time. The structure and functionality were inspired by a YouTube
                tutorial I followed. I made adjustments along the way to better understand how everything works
                together. The project includes an index.html file for the layout, a style.css file for styling, and a
                script.js file for the logic and interactivity. This was a great opportunity for me to get back into
                front-end development and reinforce the basics. For features I developed in my final version, such as
                the Change Name and Clear Task features, I took inspiration from my friend who is completing the same
                project.</p>
