        <p>I created a simple Cookie Clicker application using Java's Swing library as part of a self-study project. The app simulates the classic clicker game where you collect cookies by clicking a button. Throughout the development process, I utilised resources like YouTube tutorials, Codeium, and Stack Overflow to help with coding challenges and refine my understanding of Java and Swing components.</p>

            <p>For my Object-Oriented Programming module at Teesside University, I developed this Java OOP project as a prototype for Exciting Activities Ltd. It allows users to manage activities, itineraries, and costs efficiently. Key features include activity and itinerary management, business rules validation, data persistence via file handling, a console-based interface with input validation, and a Swing-based GUI for viewing itineraries. This project showcases my skills in Java, object-oriented programming, file handling, and GUI development.</p>
