# Portfolio-Website
Wordpress-Level Website Design type shiiii...
<br>
This is my personal portfolio website, which I designed and built entirely myself using HTML and CSS. It’s still a work-in-progress—the site isn’t yet responsive, and much of the content still needs to be added or updated. I started this project quite a while ago as a way to practice front-end development and showcase my work. Recently, I’ve come back to it to make minor edits, reorganise the file structure, and gradually improve the overall design. While it doesn’t currently use any JavaScript, I’ve recently started learning how to integrate JavaScript with HTML and hope to make use of it in future updates.
