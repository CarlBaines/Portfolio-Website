        <h1>Hi my name is Carl</h1>
        <p>I have currently just concluded studying a BTEC Level 3 T-Level course in Digital Production Design and Development at Middlesbrough College. I have undertaken a work placement as a part of the course which has enabled me to gain more skills and knowledge in a specialist area. I have an interest in a number of areas of computing particularly web design and development. I consider myself to be motivated, resourceful, responsible, adaptable, punctual, flexible and hard working.</p>
